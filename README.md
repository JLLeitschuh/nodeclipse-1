## Developing with Nodeclipse, Enide Studio

Read <https://nodeclipse.github.io/> that has News, post Shares, Installing details, Features list,
Usage (incl Video, Demo) with all shortcuts, Help and Hints,
 Support options, Where Helping needed, How to thank and Contact us, also History page.

### Personal message

Hello, I am Paul Verest, one of Nodeclipse [contributors](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse-1/graphs/contributors).
I am Java developer adopting Node.js ( and less PhantomJS, Nashorn etc Javascript ) into my set of tools.
In January 2013 I just started developing Node.js in Eclipse without any plugins, but then I came to the point "how to debug?".
That lead me to know Nodeclipse 0.2 by Tomoyuki Inagaki, that by that time was fork in his own account.
We unified 0.2 back into Nodeclipse organization (it automatically got name `nodeclipse-1` because `nodeclipse` repository was there),
the rest can be seen in [history](http://www.nodeclipse.org/history).

## Enhancing Nodeclipse

First give a try (using [Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/)
or any Eclipse/Enide Studio with PDE installed):

- `git clone https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse-1.git` or EGit equivalent
- (optionally, recommended) run `mvn package` to make sure the build passes locally and you got all dependencies,
 this way you won't need waiting Eclipse downloading (that can make it unresponsive)
- import as existing project "nodeclipse-1" (only root, that is general project, without any builds).
 Now you already can navigate over code
- in Project Explorer right-click a plugin project folder, e.g. "org.nodeclipse.enide.editors.jade",
 select "Select Import as Project"
- right-click chosen plugin project as select Run As -> Eclipse Application

Now you have Eclipse running with the latest version of chosen plugin!
Make your changes to the code and see it running (for some cases without launch Eclipse restart).
For example try changes Jade keywords in
[`src/org/nodeclipse/enide/editors/jade/highlight/Words.java`](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse-1/blob/master/org.nodeclipse.enide.editors.jade/src/org/nodeclipse/enide/editors/jade/highlight/Words.java)

There is also [Nodeclipse CLI Node.js project at `org.nodeclipse.ui\templates`](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse-1/tree/master/org.nodeclipse.ui/templates).

To go on some minimal Java & Eclipse plugin development skills are needed for improving code base.
Check "Plug-in development 101" <http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/os-eclipse-plugindev1/> as great tutorial by Chris Aniszczyk (2008).
That will be great starting point, that lets you get understanding.
For future references there is also often updated "Eclipse 4 RCP - Tutorial"
<http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseRCP/article.html> for new evolving e4 API by Lars Vogel.

JavaScript experienced leader could help by giving guidance and insight of trends.

Even without skills above you can do even more helping by research. Start by raising an issue,
describing what problem you want to solve, sharing some link. It maybe how to use Nodeclipse, new plugin to include,
how to support newer JavaScript features, Node.js packages, other JS libs like AngularJS, EmberJS etc.

## Diving-In

Try out next version from this sources just by `git clone`, `mvn package` , then install from .zip (see Maven build below for more).

You don't need import all project, and please change only one project per Pull Request.

Check README.md in project modules (e.g. `org.nodeclipse.debug` ). See launching Node.js logic in
[LaunchConfigurationDelegate.java](https://github.com/Nodeclipse/nodeclipse-1/blob/master/org.nodeclipse.debug/src/org/nodeclipse/debug/launch/LaunchConfigurationDelegate.java)

### Developing with PDE

From plugin.xml form click Run as Eclipse application.

If memory is not enough (getting `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: PermGen space` error when when running or debugging),
 change in launch configuration for Eclipse Application -> Arguments -> VM Arguments

	-Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=1.6 -Xms128m -Xmx784m -XX:MaxPermSize=128m -Xss2m


[see src/site/markdown/developing.md file](src/site/markdown/developing.md)

FYI when launching Eclipse Application

    Command-line arguments:  -product org.eclipse.platform.ide -data D:\Progs\Enide-Monster-08-kepler-win32\ws/../runtime-EclipseApplication -dev file:D:/Progs/Enide-Monster-08-kepler-win32/ws/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.pde.core/Eclipse Application/dev.properties -os win32 -ws win32 -arch x86 -consoleLog

Developing doesn't require maven usage, just import one project e.g. `org.nodeclipse.ui` into Eclipse with PDE.

Maven build is optional for full build with other plugins.

### Maven build

[Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) build (using [Tycho plugin](http://eclipse.org/tycho/)) is headless build, that doesn't require Eclipse.

From Nodeclipse-1 base folder just run `mvn package`. Run offline when to re-build `mvn clean package -o`.

`mvn clean package -Pquick` builds in `org.nodeclipse.site.quick/target` with less external dependencies.
It is not enough for release, e.g. because JSHint is external plugin and there are 20 more others.

`mvn clean package -Pfull` builds in `org.nodeclipse.site/target`. For release.

-[] TODO not to repeat definitions in `.site` and `.updates`

Before release

`mvn -Dtycho.mode=maven org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-versions-plugin:set-version -DnewVersion=1.0.2-SNAPSHOT -Pall`

#### Install site.zip (quick and simple way)

1. Locate zip file under `org.nodeclipse.site\target` in Project Explorer, StartExplore-> Copy Resource Path to Clipboard
2. Help -> Install New Software ...
3. <kbd>Add...</kbd>
4. <kbd>Archive...</kbd>
5. Insert copied string into name and path.
 E.g. `C:\Users\pverest\git\nodeclipse-056\org.nodeclipse.site\target\org.nodeclipse.site-0.5.0-SNAPSHOT.zip`

For the next time just select the zip entry from Work With drop-down list.

#### Install from freshly built p2 repository (cool and long way)

2. `npm install http-server -g`
3. `http-server org.nodeclipse.site\target\repository -p 8010`
4. start http://localhost:8010/
5. // navigate `http://localhost:8010/` in browser to check
5. Help->Install New Software, enter http://localhost:8010/ in Work With

#### Tools

### A lot of words from 2013

Below is long and a little bit old notes. You should better start with building yourself, checking <http://www.nodeclipse.org>

### Shelved

- [Eclipse Json Editor Plugin](http://sourceforge.net/p/eclipsejsonedit/wiki/Home/) Last Update: 2012-11-07
 (The JSON Editor is a simple plugin for the Eclipse IDE that provides:
  - Color text highlighting
  - An Outline Tree view
  - JSON validation
  - Text formatting - Text folding for the JSON data format.)
  No Update site.

### Code standard

1. If you edited or created file, add yourself as @author in JavaDoc or comments
2. Import <code>CodeStyle_codetemplates.xml</code> from
 <a href="https://github.com/Nodeclipse/Nodeclipse.github.io/blob/master/CodeStyle_codetemplates.xml">Nodeclipse.github.io</a></p>
	Instructions are inside the xml file.
 	This will add @author in new files automatically. Use <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+J</kbd> to quickly insert in existing files.

### Update forked project

If you forked into your account, after a while it is possible that code at original repository was updated.

With git command line you need to open project base folder, then

<pre><code>
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Nodeclipse/project-you-forked.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
git push origin master
</code></pre>

With EGit you should do the same steps but within GUI.

### Send Pull Request steps

1. Push to your remote <code>origin</code> (your account)
2. Open GitHub page for your fork
3. Press <kbd>Pull Request</kbd>
4. Review Commits on Commits tab
5. Write description, press <kbd>Send pull request</kbd>

### Testing

Build from sources, install in Eclipse, give a try.
